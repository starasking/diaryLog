Chinese calligraphy is the art form of Chinese educated elite
so for the last almost two thousand years
this has been  the art form practiced by Chinese educated elite
all members of the educated elite have some capability at calligraphy
because they have to know calligraphy
in order to pass the imperial exams

We all know that there are people who read your character from your handwriting
but Chinese take that to the next lever
and they say if you don't have great calligraphy you cannot be a good person
so actually when you take imperial exams
part of the exam is judging your calligraphy
if you don't have the calligraphy you are not a good person
you don't pass the exams

So every member of Chinese educated elite is at least confident,
and actually is quite good at calligraphy

What we have here are those rise
above being just good
these are truly great.
And we are really fortunate not just have great calligraphers
but also great works by these great calligraphers

So it is one of those art form that has
a lot of layers, a lot of meaning, and a lot of depth
and long long tradition
and make it very complex and fascinating subject

One of the artist in this exhibition we have two words by this artist
is a man named Wen Zhengming
and he lived in fifteen hundreds

And he took the imperial exams,
and he was ranked at the third rank in his calligraphy
so that's not passing, that is actually not do good enough to pass

So for the time after that
everyday he did a thousand character essay
this is a traditional text which actually which does have a thousand characters
none of which is repeated
so it's a thousand separate characters

He did that 10 times a day until he perfected his calligraphy in the different scripts
